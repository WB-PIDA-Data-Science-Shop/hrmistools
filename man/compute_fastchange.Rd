\title{Calculate year-over-year growth for a numeric column (data.table version)}
\usage{
compute_fastchange(data, col, date_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table containing the data.}

\item{col}{A numeric column (either unquoted or as a string) for which the
year-over-year growth rate will be calculated.}

\item{date_col}{A date or numeric column (either unquoted or as a string)
used to order the data and define the time sequence (typically a year column).}
}
\value{
A data.table with:
\itemize{
  \item The completed `date_col` sequence.
  \item A new column named `"growth_<col>"` containing the year-over-year growth rates.
}
}
\description{
Computes the year-over-year growth rate for a numeric column in a data.table.
The function ensures a complete sequence of years between the minimum and maximum
in the date column, fills in any missing years, and calculates the growth rate
using lagged values.
}
\details{
- Missing years in the sequence are added automatically.
- Missing values in `col` result in `NA` for the corresponding growth rate.
- The first observation (or any row where the lag is missing) will have `NA`.
- The function can accept both unquoted column names or strings.
- To compute growth rates by group (e.g., country), subset or loop by group before calling this function.

\examples{
library(data.table)

dt <- data.table(
  year = c(2020, 2021, 2023),
  gdp = c(100, 110, 130)
)


# Using strings
compute_fastchange(dt, "gdp", "year")
