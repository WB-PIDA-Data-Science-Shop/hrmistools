\title{Compute Wage Budget Shares/Rates of Macroeconomic Indicators}
\usage{
compute_budgetshare(contract_df, wage_vars, macro_vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{contract_df}{A data frame containing contract-level wage data with a \code{year} and \code{country_code} column.}

\item{wage_vars}{A character vector of column names in \code{contract_df} corresponding to wage-related variables to aggregate.}

\item{macro_vars}{A character vector of macroeconomic indicators to use as denominators when computing ratios.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
  \item{year}{Year of observation.}
  \item{indicator}{Name of computed ratio (\code{wage_var_per_macro_var}).}
  \item{value}{Computed ratio value.}
}
}
\description{
Aggregates wage variables from a contracts dataset and computes ratios of total wages to selected macroeconomic indicators.
}
\details{
The function aggregates total wage payments by year, merges them with the relevant subset of the global
\code{macro_indicators} dataset for the same country and time period, and computes ratios of each
wage variable to each selected macro variable.
