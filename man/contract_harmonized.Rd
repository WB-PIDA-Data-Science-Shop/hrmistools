contract_harmonized

\description{
The contract_harmonized dataset contains 50,000 synthetic contract-level observations
consistent with the harmonization dictionary for the "Contract" module. Each record represents
an employment contract for a worker within an organization, capturing key information on
compensation, contract characteristics, and administrative geography.
All records pertain to Zambia (ISO3: ZMB).
}
\details{
The dataset was synthetically generated to reflect realistic distributions of salary levels,
contract types, and geographic coverage within Zambia. Salaries are internally consistent such
that \code{gross_salary ≥ base_salary ≥ net_salary}.
