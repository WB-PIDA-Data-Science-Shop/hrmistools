\description{
A harmonized dataset of 10,000 anonymized public sector employment contracts
for Brazil. The data illustrate how administrative human resource (HR)
information can be structured for analysis within the
**Public Institutions Data and Analytics** framework. Variables include
identifiers for contracts, workers, and organizations; employment dates;
compensation measures; and occupational classifications.
}
\details{
This dataset provides a harmonized structure for analyzing public employment
and compensation across government entities. It is intended as a demonstration
dataset for testing data pipelines, HR analytics tools, and summary functions
such as [compute_summary()].

The variables follow a consistent schema used for HRMIS-type administrative
data within the World Bank’s Governance GP. Salary variables are expressed
in **local currency units (LCU)** and are not adjusted for inflation.

                groups = c("occupation_isconame"),
