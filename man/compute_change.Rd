\title{Compute Year-over-Year Growth for a Numeric Column}
\usage{
compute_change(data, col, date_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables of interest.}

\item{col}{The numeric column for which to compute growth (unquoted).}

\item{date_col}{The date or year column used to order and complete the data (unquoted).}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the original columns plus a new column that
holds the computed year-over-year growth rates.
}
\description{
This function calculates the year-over-year growth rate for a specified numeric
column in a data frame or tibble. It automatically completes missing time periods
based on the range of the date column, ensuring continuous sequences before
computing growth. Growth is computed only for consecutive years where both
the current and previous values are available. If a year is missing in the sequence,
the growth for the next available year is set to `NA`.
}
\details{
The function uses `tidyr::complete()` to fill missing time periods between
`min(date_col)` and `max(date_col)`, and `dplyr::mutate()` to compute growth as:
\deqn{growth_t = \frac{x_t}{x_{t-1}} - 1}

However, growth is only computed when the difference between consecutive
periods equals 1 (i.e., consecutive years). If the time gap is greater than one year,
the growth value is set to `NA`.

\examples{
# Example data
df <- tibble::tibble(
  year = c(2020, 2021, 2023),
  gdp = c(100, 110, 130)
)

# Compute year-over-year growth
compute_change(df, gdp, year)
