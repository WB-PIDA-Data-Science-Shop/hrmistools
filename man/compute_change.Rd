\title{Calculate annual growth rates for a numeric column}
\usage{
compute_change(data, col, date_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing the data.}

\item{col}{A numeric column (unquoted) for which the growth rate will be calculated.}

\item{date_col}{A date column (unquoted) used to order the data and define the time sequence.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\itemize{
  \item The `date_col` column (yearly sequence from min to max).
  \item A new column named `"growth_<col>"` containing the calculated
  year-over-year growth rates.
}
}
\description{
Computes the year-over-year growth rate of a numeric column in a data frame.
The function first completes the date sequence using `tidyr::complete()` to
ensure all years between the minimum and maximum are represented, then
calculates the growth rate using lagged values.
}
\details{
- The function uses `tidyr::complete()` to fill in missing years in the date sequence.
  Missing values in `col` will result in `NA` for the corresponding growth rate.
- The first observation (or any where the lag is missing) will have `NA`.
- Grouping is by the date column to summarise across the entire dataset; if you
  have multiple series (e.g., countries), consider grouping beforehand.

library(dplyr)

df <- tibble(
  year = c(2020, 2023),
  gdp = c(100, 110, 130)
)

compute_change(df, gdp, year)
