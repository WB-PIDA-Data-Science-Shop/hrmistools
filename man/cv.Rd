\title{Compute the Coefficient of Variation (CV)}
\usage{
cv(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of values.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if `TRUE`, missing values (`NA`) are removed before
computation. Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the coefficient of variation (CV).
Returns `NA_real_` if the computation is not possible (e.g., all values are
missing or the mean is zero).
}
\description{
Calculates the coefficient of variation for a numeric vector, defined as the
ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. This provides a unitless measure
of relative dispersion, allowing comparison of variability across variables
or groups with different scales.
}
\details{
The function safely handles missing values and cases where the mean is zero
(to avoid division by zero). If the input vector is empty or the mean equals
zero, the function returns `NA_real_`.

\examples{
x <- c(10, 12, 8, 15, NA)
cv(x)
