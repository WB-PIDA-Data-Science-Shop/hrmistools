\title{Detect hire events based on worker and contract data}
\usage{
detect_hire_events(worker_df, contract_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{worker_df}{A data frame or tibble containing worker information.
Must include at least the columns:
- `worker_id`: Unique identifier for each worker.
- `status`: Employment status (e.g., "active").
- `ref_date`: Reference date associated with the worker's record.}

\item{contract_df}{A data frame or tibble containing contract information.
Must include at least:
- `worker_id`: Worker identifier linking to `worker_df`.
- `contract_id`: Unique contract identifier.
- `org_date`: Contract start or organization date.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing detected hire events with columns:
  - `worker_id`
  - `contract_id`
  - `ref_date`
  - `type_event` ("hire")
}
\description{
This function identifies hire events by comparing contract start dates
with worker activity in previous reference periods. A hire is defined as
a contract that appears in the current period but not in the previous one.

\dontrun{
event_hires <- detect_hire_events(worker_df = workers, contract_df = contracts)
