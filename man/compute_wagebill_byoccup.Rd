\title{Compute Wage Bill by Occupation}
\usage{
compute_wagebill_byoccup(contract_df, wage_vars, group_var, isco_level = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{contract_df}{A data frame of individual contract-level records including occupational codes.}

\item{wage_vars}{A character vector of wage-related variables to sum.}

\item{group_var}{A grouping variable (e.g., ministry, region) for disaggregated computation.}

\item{isco_level}{Integer (1–4). Specifies the ISCO aggregation level. Defaults to 4 (unit level).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
  \item{occupation_iscocode}{ISCO code of the occupation group.}
  \item{year}{Year of observation.}
  \item{indicator}{Name of wage variable.}
  \item{value}{Sum of wages for that occupation and year.}
}
}
\description{
Aggregates wage bill variables by occupational group and year, optionally merging with ISCO classifications.
}
\details{
If \code{isco_level < 4}, the function merges \code{contract_df} with the \code{isco} lookup table to include
broader occupational categories. The wage bill is then summed by occupation group and year, and reshaped to
a long format for further analysis.
