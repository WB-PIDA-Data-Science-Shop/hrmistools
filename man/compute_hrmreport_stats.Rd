\usage{
compute_hrmreport_stats(contract_dt, worker_dt, org_dt, macro_indicators)
}
\arguments{
\item{contract_dt}{A `data.table` containing individual employment contracts with variables such as `worker_id`, `ref_date`,
wage variables (`gross_salary_lcu`, `net_salary_lcu`, `base_salary_lcu`), and job attributes.}

\item{worker_dt}{A `data.table` containing worker-level panel data, including `worker_id`, `ref_date`, demographic and employment information.}

\item{org_dt}{A `data.table` containing organizational information (e.g., institution identifiers, types, or sectors).}

\item{macro_indicators}{A data frame containing macro indicators.}
}
\value{
A named list of `data.table` objects containing:
\describe{
  \item{wagebill_shares}{Wage bill components as shares of macro indicators.}
  \item{publicemployment_share}{Public employment as a share of total employment.}
  \item{wagebill_occupisco}{Wage bill decomposition by ISCO occupation group.}
  \item{wagebill_occupnative}{Wage bill decomposition by native occupational titles.}
  \item{wagebill_orgdecomp}{Wage bill decomposition by organization.}
  \item{wagebill_allowshare_paygrade}{Allowance rate by pay grade.}
  \item{wagebill_allowshare_seniority}{Allowance rate by seniority.}
  \item{workerevent}{Worker-level hiring, firing, and retirement events over time.}
  \item{employment_decomp}{Employment decomposition by occupation and ISCO group.}
  \item{org_decomp}{Employment decomposition by organization.}
  \item{education_profile}{Distribution of public sector workers by education, gender, and occupation.}
  \item{mobilityprofile}{Distribution of public sector workers by pay grade, seniority, gender, and occupation.}
}
}
\description{
This function generates a suite of standardized analytical tables for HRMIS (Human Resource Management Information System) reports.
It combines contract-level, worker-level, and organizational data to compute wage bill summaries, employment shares, decompositions,
and profiles by occupation, pay grade, organization, education, and seniority.
}
\details{
The function integrates contract, worker, and organizational datasets to compute a standardized HRMIS statistical report.
It relies on supporting helper functions such as:
\code{convert_constant_ppp()}, \code{compute_fastshare()}, \code{compute_fastsummary()},
\code{detect_worker_event()}, and \code{detect_retirement()}.

Each sub-table in the output list can be used directly in dashboards, reports, or further analytical aggregation.
