\title{Complete Panel Data by Identifier and Reference Dates}
\usage{
complete_dates(data, id_col, start_date, end_date, freq = "year")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or data.table containing at least an identifier column.}

\item{id_col}{Character. Name of the identifier column (e.g., `"worker_id"`).}

\item{start_date}{Character or Date. Start of the full date sequence
(e.g., `"2007-09-01"`).}

\item{end_date}{Character or Date. End of the full date sequence
(e.g., `"2018-01-01"`).}

\item{freq}{Character. Interval for date sequence passed to
\code{seq.Date(by = ...)}. Default is `"year"`.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} containing all possible combinations of identifiers
  and reference dates between the given start and end points, merged with
  the original data.
}
\description{
Expands a dataset to include all combinations of identifiers and reference
dates within a specified start–end range. This is useful for ensuring that
each identifier has a record for every time point, even if data are missing.
}
\details{
This function generates a complete identifier–date grid using
\code{seq.Date()} between \code{start_date} and \code{end_date}, then merges
it with the original dataset using a left join (\code{all.x = TRUE}).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
complete_dt <- complete_dates(
  data = worker_df,
  id_col = "worker_id",
  start_date = "2007-09-01",
  end_date = "2018-01-01",
  freq = "year"
)
}
