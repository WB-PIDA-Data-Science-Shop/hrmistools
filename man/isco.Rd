\description{
A dataset containing the structure and definitions of the International
Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08), as published by the
International Labour Organization (ILO).

\details{
The ISCO provides a system for classifying and aggregating occupational
information in order to facilitate international comparisons and
harmonization of occupational statistics. It is widely used in labor
statistics, survey design, and for policy analysis.


According to the ILO:

*ISCO is designed for international comparability of occupational
statistics and for classification of jobs in censuses, household surveys,
and administrative records. ISCO-08 is structured hierarchically with:*

- \strong{Major groups} (1 digit) – broad occupational categories such as
  "Professionals" or "Service and Sales Workers".
- \strong{Sub-major groups} (2 digits) – more detailed categories that
  subdivide major groups.
- \strong{Minor groups} (3 digits) – further disaggregation of sub-major groups.
- \strong{Unit groups} (4 digits) – the most detailed level, specifying
  occupations with similar tasks and duties.

Each unit group includes a definition outlining the tasks and duties that
characterize that occupation, as provided by the ILO ISCO documentation.
