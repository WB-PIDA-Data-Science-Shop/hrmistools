\description{
The International Classification of Occupations (ISCO) seeks to facilitate international communication about occupations by providing statisticians with a framework to make internationally comparable occupational data available, and by allowing international occupational data to be produced in a form that can be useful for research as well as for specific decision-making and action-oriented activities. The current version, known as ISCO-08, was published in 2008 and is the fourth iteration, following ISCO-58, ISCO-68 and ISCO-88.

A dataset containing the structure and definitions of the International
Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08), as published by the
International Labour Organization (ILO).

\details{
The ISCO provides a system for classifying and aggregating occupational
information in order to facilitate international comparisons and
harmonization of occupational statistics. It is widely used in labor
statistics, survey design, and for policy analysis.


According to the ILO:

*ISCO is designed for international comparability of occupational
statistics and for classification of jobs in censuses, household surveys,
and administrative records. ISCO-08 is structured hierarchically with:*

- \strong{Major groups} (1 digit) – broad occupational categories such as
  "Professionals" or "Service and Sales Workers".
- \strong{Sub-major groups} (2 digits) – more detailed categories that
  subdivide major groups.
- \strong{Minor groups} (3 digits) – further disaggregation of sub-major groups.
- \strong{Unit groups} (4 digits) – the most detailed level, specifying
  occupations with similar tasks and duties.

Each unit group includes a definition outlining the tasks and duties that
characterize that occupation, as provided by the ILO ISCO documentation.
