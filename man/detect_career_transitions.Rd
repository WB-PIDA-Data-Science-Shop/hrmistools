\title{Detect Career Transitions Based on Contract Attributes}
\usage{
detect_career_transitions(contract_dt, vars, decision_var, decision_fn = max)
}
\arguments{
\item{contract_dt}{A `data.table`, `data.frame` object containing contract level records.
Must include columns for `worker_id`, `ref_date`, the variables listed in `vars`,
and the `decision_var`.}

\item{vars}{A character vector of attribute names (column names) to monitor for changes
(e.g., `c("paygrade", "seniority")`).}

\item{decision_var}{A string specifying the column name used to identify the dominant
contract per worker and date (e.g., `"base_salary_lcu"`).}

\item{decision_fn}{A function defining the decision rule for selecting the dominant
contract within each worker-date group (default: `max`). Typically `max`, `min`, or
a custom summary function.}
}
\value{
A `data.table` with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{worker_id}{Unique worker identifier.}
  \item{start_date}{Date of the previous contract before the change.}
  \item{ref_date}{Date when the new attribute value takes effect.}
  \item{attribute}{Name of the attribute that changed.}
  \item{from}{Previous value of the attribute.}
  \item{to}{New value of the attribute.}
}
}
\description{
Identifies transitions in specified job-related attributes (e.g., pay grade, seniority)
for each worker over time. The function first determines the "dominant" contract
per worker and reference date based on a decision variable (e.g., highest base salary),
and then detects when the selected attributes change across time.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
  \item Sorts contracts by `worker_id`, `ref_date`, and the decision variable.
  \item Selects the dominant contract per worker-date combination using `decision_fn`.
  \item For each attribute in `vars`, compares its value to the previous record
  (by worker) and detects any changes.
  \item Returns all transitions, including the attribute name, previous and new values,
  and the start and end dates for the transition.
}

The function assumes that higher values of `decision_var` represent more dominant
contracts when `decision_fn = max`. If ties occur, the first instance is selected.

dt <- data.table(
  worker_id = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2),

                       "2020-06-01", "2021-06-01")),
  paygrade = c("A", "A", "B", "C", "D"),
  seniority = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2),
  base_salary_lcu = c(50000, 55000, 60000, 40000, 42000)
