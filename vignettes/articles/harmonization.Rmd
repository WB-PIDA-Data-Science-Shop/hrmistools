# Overview

This article describes the standard approach for harmonizing human resource management information system (HRMIS) data, organized into three main modules: Organization, Worker, and Contract. The contents of each module are described in `vignette("standard_dictionary")`

# A demo data

Suppose the Government of Zambia shared with us an extraction of their HRMIS data. First, let's take a closer look at the data.

```{r}
library(hrmistools)
library(reactable)

reactable(
  contract_harmonized
)
```
