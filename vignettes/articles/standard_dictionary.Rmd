# Overview

This article describes the standard dictionary for human resource management information system (HRMIS) data, organized into three main modules: Organization, Worker, and Contract. These modules are designed to organize and standardize information about public sector personnel across different countries and administrative levels.

# Module 1: Organization

The Organization module captures information about public sector institutions, including ministries, departments, and agencies.

## Fields

| Field Name | Variable Name | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Organization ID | `org_id` | Unique identifier for the organization |
| Organization Name (Native) | `org_name_native` | Official organization name in local language |
| Organization Name (English) | `org_name_en` | Organization name translated to English |
| Reference Date | `ref_date` | Latest date when the organization had that name |
| Organization Type | `org_type` | Type of organization (Ministry/Department/Agency) |
| Parent Organization | `org_parent` | Identifier for parent organization in hierarchy |
| Child Organization | `org_child` | Identifier for child organizations in hierarchy |
| Country Code | `country_code` | Official World Bank ISO-3 country code |
| Country Name | `country_name` | Official World Bank country name |
| Administration 1 Name | `adm1_name` | First-level administrative division name |
| Administration 1 Code | `adm1_code` | First-level administrative division code |

## Notes

- **Organization Type**: Indicates the hierarchical level of the institution within the government structure. Ideally, this would support parent-child relationships, though such data may be rare in practice.
- **Administration Level**: Refers to the geographic/administrative level of government (e.g., national, state/provincial, local).
- **Reference Date**: Critical for tracking organizational changes, mergers, or renaming over time.

# Module 2: Worker

The Worker module contains demographic and employment information about individual public sector employees.

## Fields

| Field Name | Variable Name | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Worker ID | `worker_id` | Unique identifier for the worker |
| Organization ID | `org_id` | Foreign key linking to Organization module |
| Organization Name | `org_name_native` | Foreign key linking to the Organization module | 
| Reference Date | `ref_date` | Timestamp for the worker record |
| Date of Birth | `birth_date` | Worker's date of birth |
| Gender | `gender` | Worker's gender |
| Education Attainment (7 categories) | `educat7` | Education level using 10-category classification |
| Tribe | `tribe` | Tribal affiliation|
| Race | `race` | Racial/ethnic classification |
| Country Code | `country_code` | Official World Bank ISO-3 country code |
| Country Name | `country_name` | Official World Bank country name |
| Administration 1 Name | `adm1_name` | First-level administrative division name |
| Administration 1 Code | `adm1_code` | First-level administrative division code |

## Notes

- **Education Categories**: Multiple classification systems are provided to allow for cross-country comparisons and mapping to international standards.
- **Geographic Information**: While workers are linked to organizations, separate geographic fields allow for tracking mobility and remote work arrangements.
- **Privacy Considerations**: This module contains sensitive personal information and should be handled according to applicable data protection regulations.

# Module 3: Contract

The Contract module captures details about employment contracts, compensation, and job characteristics.

## Fields

| Field Name | Variable Name | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Contract ID | `contract_id` | Unique identifier for the contract |
| Worker ID | `worker_id` | Foreign key linking to Worker module |
| Organization ID | `org_id` | Foreign key linking to Organization module |
| Organization Name | `org_name_native` | Foreign key linking to Organization module |
| Reference Date | `ref_date` | Timestamp for the contract record |
| Base Salary (LCU) | `base_salary_lcu` | Base compensation in local currency units |
| Base Salary (PPP) | `base_salary_ppp` | Base compensation in constant 2021 international dollars |
| Gross Salary (LCU) | `gross_salary_lcu` | Total compensation before deductions in local currency units|
| Gross Salary (PPP) | `gross_salary_ppp` | Total compensation before deductions in constant 2021 international dollars|
| Net Salary (LCU)| `net_salary_lcu` | Compensation after deductions in local currency units|
| Net Salary (PPP)| `net_salary_ppp` | Compensation after deductions in constant 2021 international dollars|
| Allowances (LCU) | `allowance_lcu` | Allowances in local currency units |
| Allowances (PPP) | `allowance_ppp` Allowances in constant 2021 international dollars |
| Contract Type | `contract_type` | Contract modality (short-term/open-term/permanent/inactive/retired) |
| Occupation (Native) | `occupation_native` | Job title in local language |
| Occupation (English) | `occupation_english` | Job title translated to English |
| Occupation (ISCO Name) | `occupation_isconame` | ISCO standard occupation name |
| Occupation (ISCO Code) | `occupation_iscocode` | ISCO standard occupation code |
| Start Date | `start_date` | Contract start date |
| End Date | `end_date` | Contract end date (if applicable) |
| Country Code | `country_code` | Official World Bank ISO-3 country code |
| Country Name | `country_name` | Official World Bank country name |
| Administration 1 Name | `adm1_name` | First-level administrative division name |
| Administration 1 Code | `adm1_code` | First-level administrative division code |
| Hours Worked | `whours` | Standard or actual hours worked |
| Pay Grade | `paygrade` | Salary scale or grade level |
| Seniority | `seniority` | Years of service or seniority level |

## Notes

- **Compensation Fields**: Multiple salary measures allow for analysis of gross-to-net ratios, taxation effects, and allowances.
- **Occupation Coding**: Both native and standardized (ISCO) classifications enable within-country detail and cross-country comparability.
- **Contract Duration**: The combination of `contract_type`, `start_date`, and `end_date` provides comprehensive information about employment stability and temporary arrangements.

# Relationship between modules

The three modules are related as follows:

```
Organization (1) ←→ (N) Worker
Organization (1) ←→ (N) Contract
Worker (1) ←→ (N) Contract
```

- One organization can have many workers
- One organization can have many contracts
- One worker can have multiple contracts (over time or concurrent)

# Data Quality Considerations

1. **Temporal Consistency**: Ensure `ref_date` fields are properly maintained across all modules
2. **Geographic Consistency**: Country and administration codes should be consistent across all modules
3. **Unique Identifiers**: All ID fields should be globally unique and persistent
4. **Missing Data**: Document conventions for handling missing or unavailable data
5. **Historical Records**: Consider versioning strategy for tracking changes over time
