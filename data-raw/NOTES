#### Harmonization Planning

Overview
- Purpose of the harmonization (eg improve their strategic HRM and fiscal planning)
More specifically, we are interested being able to study hiring patterns, dismissals/resignations,
reassignments, pensions, wage bill and public sector wage premiums.
- Scope of the data
- Target Audience (governments, country teams, researchers, donors)

Data Sources and Coverage
- HRMIS systems included (e.g., SAP HR, Oracle, custom national systems)
- Time coverage
- Sector coverage (central government, local government, parastatals)

Variable Definitions
- Talk about the modules (Organization, Worker and Contract modules)

    Organization
      - Organization ID (org_id)
      - Organization Name, Native (org_name_native)
      - Organization Name, English (org_name_english)
      - Latest date when the organization had that name, (org_date)
      - Type of organization: Ministry/Department/Agency. # GK note: I am thinking about the level of hierarchy of an institution. Ideally, we would have parent-child relationships, but I suspect that is rare (org_parent, org_child)
      - Data corresponding date, (ref_date)
      - Country Code, (country_code) Official World Bank ISO-3 code
      - Country Name, (country_name) Official World Bank country name
      - Administration 1 Name, (adm1_name) # GK note: we have to be specific about what do we mean by administration here. Is it the level of government?
      - Administration 1 Code, (adm1_code)


    Worker
      - Worker ID (worker_id)
      - Organization ID (org_id)
      - Timestamp (org_date)
      - Date of Birth (birth_day)
      - Gender (gender)
      - Education Attainment (educat4, educat5, educat7, and educat10)
      - Tribe (tribe)
      - Race (race)
      - Status (active/retired)
      - Country Code, (country_code)
      - Country Name, (country_name)
      - Administration 1 Name, (adm1_name)
      - Administration 1 Code, (adm1_code)


    Contract
      - Contract ID (contract_id)
      - Worker ID (worker_id)
      - Organization ID (org_id)
      - Timestamp (org_date)
      - Compensation (base_salary, gross_salary, net_salary)
      - cpi (consumer price index)
      - ppp (purchasing power parity)
      - Modality of Contract (short-term, open-term, permanent) (contract_type)
      - Occupation Code (ISCO) (occupation_code)
      - Start Date (start_date)
      - End Date (end_date)
      - Country Code, country_code
      - Country Name, country_name
      - Administration 1 Name, adm1_name
      - Administration 1 Code, adm1_code
      - Hours worked (whours)


** Analytics of interest:

- Wage bill forecasting: wage bill projections and scenario modelling
modelling payroll trends and simulating the long-term fiscal impacts of hiring or pay reform policies

- staff deployment and capacity analysis
analyzing staff distribution across ministries or regions and identifying over- or under- staffing patterns

- Turnover and retention tracking
tracking hires, departures and tenure by unit or manager to highligh retention issues.

- Pay inequality detection
comparing compensation levels across organizational units to uncover disparities in pay for similar positions

- Absence and overtime analytics

** Harmonization strategy:

We need a generalizable approach that enable us to map, for a specific column $x$, all of its values to a predetermined set of values, defined by the team.
Ideally, this mapping should be dataset and time-period specific.
