## Details

The ISCO provides a system for classifying and aggregating occupational
information to facilitate international comparisons and harmonization of
occupational statistics. It is widely used in labor statistics, survey
design, and policy analysis.

ISCO-08 is structured hierarchically: - **Major groups** (1 digit) –
broad occupational categories - **Sub-major groups** (2 digits) –
subdivisions of major groups - **Minor groups** (3 digits) –
subdivisions of sub-major groups - **Unit groups** (4 digits) – most
detailed level, individual occupations

Each unit group includes a description outlining the scope of the
occupation according to ILO’s ISCO-08 documentation.
