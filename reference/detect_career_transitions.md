# Detect Career Transitions Based on Contract Attributes

Identifies transitions in specified job-related attributes (e.g., pay
grade, seniority) for each worker over time. The function first
determines the "dominant" contract per worker and reference date based
on a decision variable (e.g., highest base salary), and then detects
when the selected attributes change across time.

## Usage

``` r
detect_career_transitions(contract_dt, vars, decision_var, decision_fn = max)
```

## Arguments

- contract_dt:

  A \`data.table\`, \`data.frame\` object containing contract level
  records. Must include columns for \`worker_id\`, \`ref_date\`, the
  variables listed in \`vars\`, and the \`decision_var\`.

- vars:

  A character vector of attribute names (column names) to monitor for
  changes (e.g., \`c("paygrade", "seniority")\`).

- decision_var:

  A string specifying the column name used to identify the dominant
  contract per worker and date (e.g., \`"base_salary_lcu"\`).

- decision_fn:

  A function defining the decision rule for selecting the dominant
  contract within each worker-date group (default: \`max\`). Typically
  \`max\`, \`min\`, or a custom summary function.

## Value

A \`data.table\` with the following columns:

- worker_id:

  Unique worker identifier.

- start_date:

  Date of the previous contract before the change.

- ref_date:

  Date when the new attribute value takes effect.

- attribute:

  Name of the attribute that changed.

- from:

  Previous value of the attribute.

- to:

  New value of the attribute.

## Details

The function:

1.  Sorts contracts by \`worker_id\`, \`ref_date\`, and the decision
    variable.

2.  Selects the dominant contract per worker-date combination using
    \`decision_fn\`.

3.  For each attribute in \`vars\`, compares its value to the previous
    record (by worker) and detects any changes.

4.  Returns all transitions, including the attribute name, previous and
    new values, and the start and end dates for the transition.

The function assumes that higher values of \`decision_var\` represent
more dominant contracts when \`decision_fn = max\`. If ties occur, the
first instance is selected.

## Examples

``` r
library(data.table)
dt <- data.table(
  worker_id = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2),
  ref_date = as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2021-01-01", "2022-01-01",
                       "2020-06-01", "2021-06-01")),
  paygrade = c("A", "A", "B", "C", "D"),
  seniority = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2),
  base_salary_lcu = c(50000, 55000, 60000, 40000, 42000)
)

detect_career_transitions(
  contract_dt = dt,
  vars = c("paygrade", "seniority"),
  decision_var = "base_salary_lcu"
)
