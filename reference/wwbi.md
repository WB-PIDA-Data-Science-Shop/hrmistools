# Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators

The Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators (WWBI) database is a unique
cross-national dataset on public sector employment and wages that aims
to fill an information gap, thereby helping researchers, development
practitioners, and policymakers gain a better understanding of the
personnel dimensions of state capability, the footprint of the public
sector within the overall labor market, and the fiscal implications of
the public sector wage bill. The dataset is derived from administrative
data and household surveys, thereby complementing existing, expert
perception-based approaches.
